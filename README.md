## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Bruno

I dabble in making interactive experiences and tools that work for people.

Looking to create a <ins>**polished experience for users**</ins> with a <ins>**solid technical foundation**</ins> I went up and down the levels of abstraction:

ðŸš€ Started out as a ***game designer***, then worked on autonomous underwater vehicle ***simulation and testing*** in Unity

ðŸ’¼ Worked as a ***UX/UI designer***, then ***frontend*** dev, then ***fullstack***, now learning ***sysadmin*** and ***embedded*** development

ðŸ§  Attended lectures on ***cognitive science***, completed a ***Robotics Engineering*** degree, now I'm learning to ***make my own hardware***
